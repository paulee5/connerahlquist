<h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
  <h2>I'm a 16 year old student that is attending Madison academic. I am a sophomore but I am taking junior classes. I am taking Algebra 2, Coding 1, PE, and World History. I want to be either a mechanical engineer or a first responder in law enforcement. My dad is one of my biggest inspirations in this area because he never gave up on his dream to become a deputy. He kept pushing even when nothing was near. And he didn't stop there he went on to become the officer of the year in his first 6 months of being in the department. I want to end up like him.</h2>
